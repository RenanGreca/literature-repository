In such environments, assuring high developer productivity is strongly dependent on conducting testing efficiently and effectively. Specifically, to shorten feedback cycles, test prioritization is popularly used as an optimiza-tion mechanism for ranking tests to run by their likelihood of revealing failures. To apply test prioritization in indus-trial environments, we present a novel approach (tailored for practical applicability) that integrates multiple existing techniques via a systematic framework of machine learning to rank. Our initial empirical evaluation on a large real-world dataset from Salesforce.com shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing individual techniques.", "published_in": "FSE 2016: Proceedings of the 2016 24th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering", "publisher": "ACM", "doi": "10.1145/2950290.2983954", "date": "2016-11-01", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "TRUE", "exp_subjects": "Automation system at Salesforce (~45000 TCs)\n\nIndustrial proprietary, very large scale", "prog_language": "Java", "ind_partner": "Salesforce (USA)", "ind_author": "TRUE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "FALSE", "put_practice": "FALSE", "suppl_url": "", "approach": "Machine learning-based (algo)\n\nCode coverage-based, similarity-based, history-based, test age (info)", "info_approach": "History-based, Coverage-based", "alg_approach": "Similarity / distance-based, Machine learning-based", "metrics": "APFD, recall", "effe_metrics": "Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD), Accuracy/precision/recall", "effi_metrics": "", "other_metrics": "", "open_challenges": "Deepen learning, adding more features."}
