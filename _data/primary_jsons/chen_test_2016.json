For compiler testing, the demand for both effectiveness and efficiency imposes challenge to test case prioritization. In the literature, most existing approaches prioritize test cases by using some coverage information (e.g., statement coverage or branch coverage), which is collected with considerable extra effort. Although input-based test case prioritization relies only on test inputs, it can hardly be applied when test inputs are programs. In this paper we propose a novel text-vector based test case prioritization approach, which prioritizes test cases for C compilers without coverage information. Our approach first transforms each test case into a text-vector by extracting its tokens which reflect fault-relevant characteristics and then prioritizes test cases based on these text-vectors. In particular, in our approach we present three prioritization strategies: greedy strategy, adaptive random strategy, and search strategy. To investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, we conduct an experiment on two C compilers (i.e., GCC and LLVM), and find that our approach is much more efficient than the existing approaches and is effective in prioritizing test cases.", "published_in": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)", "publisher": "IEEE", "doi": "10.1109/ICST.2016.19", "date": "2016-07-21", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "TRUE", "exp_subjects": "C compilers GCC (3.3M LOC) and LLVM (4.7M LOC)", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "TRUE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "FALSE", "put_practice": "FALSE", "suppl_url": "", "approach": "text-vector based (similarity)", "metrics": "-APFD\n-time spent in prioritization", "open_challenges": "n/a"}
