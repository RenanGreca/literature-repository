Most existing techniques are too expensive for handling modern massive systems and moreover depend on artifacts, such as code coverage metrics or specification models, that are not commonly available at large scale. We present a family of novel very efficient approaches for similaritybased test suite reduction that apply algorithms borrowed from the big data domain together with smart heuristics for finding an evenly spread subset of test cases. The approaches are very general since they only use as input the test cases themselves (test source code or command line input).We evaluate four approaches in a version that selects a fixed budget B of test cases, and also in an adequate version that does the reduction guaranteeing some fixed coverage. The results show that the approaches yield a fault detection loss comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, while providing huge gains in terms of efficiency. When applied to a suite of more than 500K real world test cases, the most efficient of the four approaches could select B test cases (for varying B values) in less than 10 seconds.", "published_in": "2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "publisher": "IEEE", "doi": "10.1109/ICSE.2019.00055", "date": "2019-08-26", "tcp": "", "tcs": "", "tsr": "X", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "FALSE", "exp_subjects": "", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "FALSE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "TRUE", "put_practice": "FALSE", "suppl_url": "https://zenodo.org/record/2550079", "approach": "Similarity-based", "metrics": "Fault detection loss, test suite reduction, time", "open_challenges": ""}
