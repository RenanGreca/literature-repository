    "abstract": "Westermo Research and Development has developed SuiteBuilder, an \nautomated tool to determine an effective ordering of regression test \ncases. The ordering is based on factors such as fault detection success,\n the interval since the last execution, and code modifications. \nSuiteBuilder has enabled Westermo to overcome numerous \nregression-testing problems, including lack of time to run a complete \nregression suite, failure to detect bugs in a timely manner, and \nrepeatedly omitted tests. In the tool's first two years of use, \nreordered test suites finished in the available time, most \nfault-detecting test cases were located in the first third of suites, no\n important test case was omitted, and the necessity for manual work on \nthe suites decreased greatly.",
