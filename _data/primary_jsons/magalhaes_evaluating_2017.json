In general, a system evolves from change requests, aiming at improving its behavior in terms of new features as well as fixing failures. Thus, selecting the best test plan in terms of the closeness between test cases and the changed code and its dependencies is pursued by industry and academia. In this paper we measure the coverage achieved by an automatic test case selection based on information retrieval that relates change requests and test cases. But instead of using off-the-shelf coverage tools, like JaCoCo, we propose a way of obtaining code coverage of Android apk's without instrumentation. This was a basic requirement of our industrial partner. We performed some experiments on this industrial partner and promising results were obtained.", "published_in": "SAST: Proceedings of the 2nd Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing", "publisher": "ACM", "doi": "10.1145/3128473.3128478", "date": "2017-09-18", "tcp": "", "tcs": "X", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "TRUE \n(Motorola)", "exp_subjects": "", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "FALSE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE \n(not stated, but it is implied due to the collaboration)", "avai_tool": "FALSE", "put_practice": "TRUE", "suppl_url": "", "approach": "Change-based, requirements-based", "metrics": "Coverage; selection count; failures detected", "open_challenges": "Compare automated selection with manual selection; how to improve available tests; find relationship between code changes and text representations of test cases."}
