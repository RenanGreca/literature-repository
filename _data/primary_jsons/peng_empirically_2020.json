While TCP has been studied for over 20 years, it was almost always evaluated using seeded faults/mutants as opposed to using real test failures. In this work, we study the recent change-aware information retrieval (IR) technique for TCP. Prior work has shown it performing better than traditional coverage-based TCP techniques, but it was only evaluated on a small-scale dataset with a cost-unaware metric based on seeded faults/mutants. We extend the prior work by conducting a much larger and more realistic evaluation as well as proposing enhancements that substantially improve the performance. In particular, we evaluate the original technique on a large-scale, real-world software-evolution dataset with real failures using both cost-aware and cost-unaware metrics under various configurations. Also, we design and evaluate hybrid techniques combining the IR features, historical test execution time, and test failure frequencies. Our results show that the change-aware IR technique outperforms stateof-the-art coverage-based techniques in this real-world setting, and our hybrid techniques improve even further upon the original IR technique. Moreover, we show that flaky tests have a substantial impact on evaluating the change-aware TCP techniques based on real test failures.\n", "published_in": "ISSTA 2020: Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis", "publisher": "ACM", "doi": "10.1145/3395363.3397383", "date": "2020-07-18", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "FALSE", "exp_subjects": "Open-source Java projects (up to 144 TCs)", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "FALSE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "FALSE", "put_practice": "FALSE", "suppl_url": "https://sites.google.com/view/ir-based-tcp", "approach": "Information retrieval; the idea is that code changes can be used to construct queries which in turn lead to related tests by finding textual similarities (e.g. variable names, function calls).", "metrics": "APFD, APFDc", "open_challenges": ""}
