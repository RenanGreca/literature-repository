Regression testing for each mergence is characterized by continually changing test suite, limited execution time, and fast feedback, which demands new test optimization techniques. Reinforcement learning is introduced for test case prioritization to save computing resources in continuous integration environment, where a reasonable reward function is highly important for learning strategy, since the process of reinforcement learning is a reward-guided behavior. In this paper, APHFW, a novel reward function is proposed by using partial historical information of test cases effectively for fast feedback and cost reduction. The experiments are based on three open-source data sets, and the results show that the proposed reward function is more cost-effect than other reinforcement learning rewards in continuous integration environment.", "published_in": "Internetware '19: Proceedings of the 11th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Internetware", "publisher": "ACM", "doi": "10.1145/3361242.3361258", "date": "2019-10-28", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "TRUE", "exp_subjects": "GSDTSR (5555 TCs) plus datasets from ABB Robotics (up to 2086 TCs)\n\nIndustrial open-source, large scale", "prog_language": "Unclear", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "FALSE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "FALSE", "put_practice": "FALSE", "suppl_url": "", "approach": "TCP by Reinforcement Learning, the paper experiments different windows on which the reward is calculated, in cmparison with Speiker (only recent observation) and He (full history)", "info_approach": "", "alg_approach": "Machine learning-based", "metrics": "NAPFD\nTime cost of prioritization function", "effe_metrics": "Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD)", "effi_metrics": "Execution time", "other_metrics": "", "open_challenges": "use windows of dynamic size"}
