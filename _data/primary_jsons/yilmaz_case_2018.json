Especially with agile development practices being increasingly used, regression testing needs to be fast and practical enough to coexist with the nature of agile development. To satisfy this need, Regression Test Selection (RTS) techniques are proposed to reduce number of tests. Although there are many studies analyzing these techniques and their effectiveness in terms of the number of reduced tests, time and cost; the applicability and practicality aspects have been mostly neglected. To this end, in this paper a case study is carried out to compare highly cited and mostly used RTS techniques. Selected techniques are applied on extensively used and tested open-source software projects, and the result of their comparison in regards of practicality, applicability, performance and cost-effectiveness are discussed.", "published_in": "Proceedings of the 12th Turkish National Software Engineering Symposium ", "publisher": "CEUR", "doi": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2201/UYMS_YTM_2018_paper_87.pdf", "date": "2018-09-10", "tcp": "", "tcs": "X", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "ind_motivation": "TRUE", "ind_evaluation": "FALSE", "exp_subjects": "Open-source Java projects (up to 361 TCs)\n\nOpen-source, small scale", "prog_language": "Java", "ind_partner": "", "ind_author": "FALSE", "prac_feedback": "FALSE", "avai_tool": "N/A", "put_practice": "N/A", "suppl_url": "", "approach": "Comparison of change-based and graph-based techniques", "metrics": "testing time, selection rate", "open_challenges": ""}
