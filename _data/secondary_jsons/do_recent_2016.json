They are enhanced, corrected, and ported to new platforms. These changes can affect a system adversely, thus software engineers perform regression testing to ensure the quality of the modified systems. Regression testing is an integral part of most major software projects, but as projects grow larger and the number of tests increases, performing regression testing becomes more costly. To address this problem, many researchers and practitioners have proposed and empirically evaluated various regression testing techniques, such as regression test selection, test case prioritization, and test suite minimization. Recent surveys on these techniques indicate that this research area continues to grow, heuristics and the types of data utilized become diverse, and wider application domains have been considered. This chapter presents the current status and the trends of three regression testing techniques and discusses recent advances of each technique.", "published_in": "Advances in Computers", "publisher": "Elsevier", "bibtex": "do_recent_2016", "doi": "10.1016/bs.adcom.2016.04.004", "date": "2016-05-10", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "X", "tsr": "X", "tsa": "", "paper_count": "12", "years_covered": "2010-2016", "systematic": "", "context": ""}
