In the past years, test-case prioritization has gained much attention, and has significant achievements in five aspects: prioritization algorithms, coverage criteria, measurement, practical concerns involved, and application scenarios. In this article, we will first review the achievements of test-case prioritization from these five aspects and then give our perspectives on its challenges.", "published_in": "Frontiers of Computer Science", "publisher": "Springer", "bibtex": "hao_test-case_2016", "doi": "10.1007/s11704-016-6112-3", "date": "2016-06-29", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "", "tsr": "", "tsa": "", "paper_count": "27", "years_covered": "1999-2016", "systematic": "", "context": ""}
