With the design and execution of test cases, it is possible to verify new or modified code, as well as to verify existing versions of it. In order to prevent new defects from spreading over existing versions of the code, it is necessary to strategically re-run different test cases. This activity is known as software regression testing and can constitute a high percentage of the total cost of the verification process. Researchers continuously are dealing with making software regression testing efficient. In order to shed light on the application of software regression testing in industry, this paper presents a literature review on different aspects of regression testing applied in industrial settings. As a result, 40 primary studies that report the use of regression testing in the industry were identified. We observe that the main regression testing technique used is the selection of test cases followed by the prioritization of them. The use of combinations of metrics based on coverage, requirements, risk, defects, cost-efficiency searches is also observed.", "published_in": "The International Conference on Advances in Emerging Trends and Technologies", "publisher": "Springer", "bibtex": "rosero2021software", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-96147-3_18", "date": "2022-02-10", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "X", "tsr": "X", "tsa": "", "paper_count": "40", "years_covered": "2002-2020", "systematic": "X", "context": ""}
