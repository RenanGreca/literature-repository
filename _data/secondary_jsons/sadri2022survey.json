CPSs need to be safe and reliable and function in accordance with their requirements. Testing, focusing on a CPS model and/or its code, is the primary approach used by engineers to achieve this. Generating, selecting and prioritizing test cases that can reveal faults in CPSs, from the wide range of possible input values and stimuli that affect their operation, are of central importance in this process. To date, however, in our search of the literature, we have found no comprehensive survey of research on test case generation, selection and prioritization for CPSs. In this article, therefore, we report the results of a survey of approaches for generating, selecting and prioritizing test cases for CPSs; the results illustrate the progress that has been made on these approaches to date, the properties that characterize the approaches and the challenges that remain open in these areas of research.", "published_in": "Software Testing, Verification and Reliability", "publisher": "Wiley", "bibtex": "sadri2022survey", "doi": "10.1002/stvr.1794", "date": "2021-09-15", "tcp": "X", "tcs": "X", "tsr": "X", "tsa": "", "paper_count": "13", "years_covered": "2015-2019", "systematic": "X", "context": "Cyber-physical"}
