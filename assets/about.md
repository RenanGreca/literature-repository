This website was created as a companion to the paper entitled 
"State of Practical Applicability of Regression Testing Research: 
A Live Systematic Literature Review".
The objective is to provide a convenient way of collecting academic
papers on the topic of software regression testing that introduce
techniques with the potential of usage in real software.

If you have written or read a paper that could be a good fit for this
website, please read the [Contribute](contribute) page.
