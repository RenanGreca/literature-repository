2016,"Srikanth, Hema; Hettiarachchi, Charitha; Do, Hyunsook",Requirements Based Test Prioritization Using Risk Factors,srikanth_requirements_2016,"Context Software testing is an expensive and time-consuming process. Software engineering teams are often forced to terminate their testing efforts due to budgetary and time constraints, which inevitably lead to long term issues with quality and customer satisfaction. Test case prioritization (TCP) has shown to improve test effectiveness. Objective The results of our prior work on requirements-based test prioritization showed improved rate of fault detection on industrial projects; the customer priority (CP) and the fault proneness (FP) were the biggest contributing factors to test effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to further investigate these two factors and apply prioritization based on these factors in a different domain: an enterprise level cloud application. We aim to provide an effective prioritization scheme that practitioners can implement with minimum effort. The other objective is to compare the results and the benefits of these two factors with two risk-based prioritization approaches that extract risks from the system requirements categories. Method Our approach involved analyzing and assigning values to each requirement based on two important factors, CP and FP, so that the test cases for high-value requirements are prioritized earlier for execution. We also proposed two requirements-based TCP approaches that use risk information of the system. Results Our results indicate that the use of CP and FP can improve the effectiveness of TCP. The results also show that the risk-based prioritization can be effective in improving the TCP. Conclusion We performed an experiment on an enterprise cloud application to measure the fault detection rate of different test suites that are prioritized based on CP, FP, and risks. The results depict that all approaches outperform the random prioritization approach, which is prevalent in the industry. Furthermore, the proposed approaches can easily be used in the industry to address the schedule and budget constraints at the testing phase.",Information and Software Technology,Elsevier,Query,10.1016/j.infsof.2015.09.002,2015-09-26,,Orchestration technique,X,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"IBM analytics application

2016,"Noor, Tanzeem Bin; Hemmati, Hadi",A similarity-based approach for test case prioritization using historical failure data,noor_similarity-based_2016,"Test case prioritization is a crucial element in software quality assurance in practice, specially, in the context of regression testing. Typically, test cases are prioritized in a way that they detect the potential faults earlier. The effectiveness of test cases, in terms of fault detection, is estimated using quality metrics, such as code coverage, size, and historical fault detection. Prior studies have shown that previously failing test cases are highly likely to fail again in the next releases, therefore, they are highly ranked, while prioritizing. However, in practice, a failing test case may not be exactly the same as a previously failed test case, but quite similar, e.g., when the new failing test is a slightly modified version of an old failing one to catch an undetected fault. In this paper, we define a class of metrics that estimate the test cases quality using their similarity to the previously failing test cases. We have conducted several experiments with five real world open source software systems, with real faults, to evaluate the effectiveness of these quality metrics. The results of our study show that our proposed similarity-based quality measure is significantly more effective for prioritizing test cases compared to existing test case quality measures. © 2015 IEEE.",2015 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),IEEE,Query,10.1109/ISSRE.2015.7381799,2016-01-14,,Orchestration technique,X,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Defects4J (up to 7927 TCs)

Due to its loosely typed, dynamic nature, test execution is time expensive and costly. Techniques for regression testing and fault-localization as well as frameworks like the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) ease the develop- ment and testing process, but still require approaches to reduce the testing effort. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of a spe- cialized, graph-walk based selective regression testing technique that aims to detect code changes on the client side in order to determine a reduced set of web tests. To do this, we analyze web applications created with GWT on different precision levels and with varying looka- heads. We examine how these parameters affect the localization of client-side code changes, run time, memory consumption and the num- ber of web tests selected for re-execution. In addition, we propose a dynamic heuristics which targets an analysis that is as exact as possible while reducing memory consumption. The results are partially appli- cable on non-GWT applications.

While the main research focus in test prioritization is on proposing novel prioritization techniques and evaluating on more and larger subject systems, little effort has been put on investigating the threats to validity in existing work on test prioritization. One main threat to validity is that existing work mainly evaluates prioritization techniques based on simple artificial changes on the source code and tests. For example, the changes in the source code usually include only seeded program faults, whereas the test suite is usually not augmented at all. On the contrary, in real-world software development, software systems usually undergo various changes on the source code and test suite augmentation. Therefore, it is not clear whether the conclusions drawn by existing work in test prioritization from the artificial changes are still valid for real-world software evolution. In this paper, we present the first empirical study to investigate this important threat to validity in test prioritization. We reimplemented 24 variant techniques of both the traditional and time-aware test prioritization, and investigated the impacts of software evolution on those techniques based on the version history of 8 real-world Java programs from GitHub. The results show that for both traditional and time-aware test prioritization, test suite augmentation significantly hampers their effectiveness, whereas source code changes alone do not influence their effectiveness much.",ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering,ACM,backward,10.1145/2884781.2884874,2016-05-14,,,X,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Open-source Java programs (up to 5269 TCs)

2016,"Vöst, Sebastian; Wagner, Stefan",Trace-based test selection to support continuous integration in the automotive industry,vost_trace-based_2016,"System testing in the automotive industry is a very expensive and time-consuming task of growing importance, because embedded systems in the domain are distributed over numerous controllers (ECUs). Modern software development techniques such as continuous integration require regular, repeated and fast testing. To achieve this in the automotive domain, test suites for a specific software change must be tailored. We propose a novel test selection technique for system-level functions in the automotive industry based on component and communication models. The idea is to follow input and output signals that are used in the testing steps through the ECUs implementing a function. We select only those tests for a planned integration in which at least one of the signals sent in its steps is processed by the ECU that was changed and thus triggered the integration. The technique is well-suited for black-box testing since it requires only the full test suite specification and the system architecture. We applied the technique to a test suite of the Active Cruise Control function at BMW Group in the context of hardware-in-the-loop system testing and found the possible reduction rates to be 82.3% on average in comparison to the full test suite.

They must be tested on a variety of compatible hardware with different configurations to ensure correct functioning of a software version on a compatible hardware. In practice, test case execution must not only execute cost-effective test cases in an optimal order, but also optimally allocate required test resources, in order to deliver high quality software releases. To optimize the current test execution system for testing software releases developed for Videoconferencing Systems (VCSs) at Cisco, Norway, in this paper, we propose a resource-aware multi-objective optimization solution with a fitness function defined based on four cost-effectiveness measures. In this context, a set of software releases must be tested on a set of compatible VCS hardware (test resources) by executing a set of cost-effective test cases in an optimal order within a given test cycle constrained by maximum allowed time budget and maximum available test resources. We empirically evaluated seven search algorithms regarding their performance and scalability by comparing with the current practice (random ordering (RO)). The results show that the proposed solution with the best search algorithm (i.e., Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm) improved the current practice by reducing on average 40.6% of time for test resource allocation and test case execution, improved test resource usage on average by 37.9% and fault detection on average by 60%.",ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion,ACM,Query,10.1145/2889160.2889240,2016-05-14,,Orchestration technique,X,,,,Software product line,,TRUE,TRUE,"Cisco videoconferencing system (305 TCs)

2016,"Srikanth, Hema; Cashman, Mikaela; Cohen, Myra B.",Test Case Prioritization of Build Acceptance Tests for an Enterprise Cloud Application,srikanth_test_2016,"The use of cloud computing brings many new opportunities for companies to deliver software in a highly-customizable and dynamic way. One such paradigm, Software as a Service (SaaS), allows users to subscribe and unsubscribe to services as needed. While beneficial to both subscribers and SaaS service providers, failures escaping to the field in these systems can potentially impact an entire customer base. Build Acceptance Testing (BAT) is a black box technique performed to validate the quality of a SaaS system every time a build is generated. In BAT, the same set of test cases is executed simultaneously across many different servers, making this a time consuming test process. Since BAT contains the most critical use cases, it may not be obvious which tests to perform first, given that the time to complete all test cases across different servers in any given day may be insufficient. While all tests must be eventually run, it is critical to run those tests first which are likely to find failures. In this work, we ask if it is possible to prioritize BAT tests for improved time to fault detection and present several different approaches, each based on the services executed when running each BAT. In an empirical study on a production enterprise system, we first analyze the historical data from several months in the field, and then use that data to derive the prioritization order for the current development BATs. We then examine if the orders change significantly when we consider fault severity using a cost-based prioritization metric. We find that the prioritization order in which we run the tests does matter, and that the use of historical information is a good heuristic for this order. Prioritized tests have an increase in the rate of fault detection, with the average percent of faults detected (APFD) increasing from less than 0.30 to as high as 0.77 on a scale of zero to one. Although severity slightly changes which order performs best, we see that there are clusters of orderings, ones which improve time to early fault detection ones which don't.",Journal of Systems and Software,Elsevier,Query,10.1016/j.jss.2016.06.017,2016-06-16,,Orchestration technique/Context-specific,X,,,,Prioritizing Build Acceptance Tests based on historical ﬁeld failures,,TRUE,TRUE,"IBM cloud application (1000+ TCs)

2017,"Blondeau, Vincent; Etien, Anne; Anquetil, Nicolas; Cresson, Sylvain; Croisy, Pascal; Ducasse, Stéphane",Test case selection in industry: an analysis of issues related to static approaches,blondeau_test_2017,"Automatic testing constitutes an important part of everyday development practice. Worldline, a major IT company, is creating more and more tests to ensure the good behavior of its applications and gains in efficiency and quality. But running all these tests may take hours. This is especially true for large systems involving, for example, the deployment of a web server or communication with a database. For this reason, tests are not launched as often as they should be and are mostly run at night. The company wishes to improve its development and testing process by giving to developers rapid feedback after a change. An interesting solution is to reduce the number of tests to run by identifying only those exercising the piece of code changed. Two main approaches are proposed in the literature: static and dynamic. The static approach creates a model of the source code and explores it to find links between changed methods and tests. The dynamic approach records invocations of methods during the execution of test scenarios. Before deploying a test case selection solution, Worldline created a partnership with us to investigate the situation in its projects and to evaluate these approaches on three industrial, closed source, cases to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each solution. We propose a classification of problems that may arise when trying to identify the tests that cover a method. We give concrete examples of these problems and list some possible solutions. We also evaluate other issues such as the impact on the results of the frequency of modification of methods or considering groups of methods instead of single ones. We found that solutions must be combined to obtain better results, and problems have different impacts on projects.

2016,"Pradhan, Dipesh; Wang, Shuai; Ali, Shaukat; Yue, Tao",Search-Based Cost-Effective Test Case Selection within a Time Budget: An Empirical Study,pradhan_search-based_2016,"Due to limited time and resources available for execution, test case selection always remains crucial for cost-effective testing. It is even more prominent when test cases require manual steps, e.g., operating physical equipment. Thus, test case selection must consider complicated trade-offs between cost (e.g., execution time) and effectiveness (e.g., fault detection capability). Based on our industrial collaboration within the Maritime domain, we identified a real-world and multi-objective test case selection problem in the context of robustness testing, where test case execution requires human involvement in certain steps, such as turning on the power supply to a device. The high-level goal is to select test cases for execution within a given time budget, where test engineers provide weights for a set of objectives, depending on testing requirements, standards, and regulations. To address the identified test case selection problem, we defined a fitness function including one cost measure, i.e., Time Difference (TD) and three effectiveness measures, i.e., Mean Priority (MPR), Mean Probability (MPO) and Mean Consequence (MC) that were identified together with test engineers. We further empirically evaluated eight multi-objective search algorithms, which include three weight-based search algorithms (e.g., Alternating Variable Method) and five Pareto-based search algorithms (e.g., Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)) using two weight assignment strategies (WASs). Notice that Random Search (RS) was used as a comparison baseline. We conducted two sets of empirical evaluations: 1) Using a real world case study that was developed based on our industrial collaboration; 2) simulating the real world case study to a larger scale to assess the scalability of the search algorithms. Results show that SPEA2 with either of the WASs performed the best for both the studies.

This resource demand can be reduced by prioritizing test cases, e.g., by focusing on tests that cover a lot of functionality.

We propose an approach for test case prioritization and selection that is based on architectural viewpoint that provides software testers with the required architectural information. We outline how architectural information is used for defining and selecting prioritized test cases. The approach has been developed in close cooperation with the provider of an enterprise SOA in the banking domain in Austria following an action research approach. In addition, the approach has been validated in an industrial case study.

Test case prioritization deals with the problem of ordering an existing set of test cases, typically with respect to the estimated likelihood of detecting faults. Test case selection addresses the problem of selecting a subset of an existing set of test cases, typically by discarding test cases that do not add any value in improving the quality of the software under test. Most existing approaches for test case prioritization and selection suffer from one or several drawbacks. For example, they to a large extent utilize static analysis of code for that purpose, making them unfit for higher levels of testing such as integration testing. Moreover, they do not exploit the possibility of dynamically changing the prioritization or selection of test cases based on the execution results of prior test cases. Such dynamic analysis allows for discarding test cases that do not need to be executed and are thus redundant. This paper proposes a generic method for prioritization and selection of test cases in integration testing that addresses the above issues.

In particular, methods for selection and prioritization of test cases can play a critical role in efficient use of testing resources. This paper focuses on the problem of selection and ordering of integration-level test cases. Integration testing is performed to evaluate the correctness of several units in composition. Further, for reasons of both effectiveness and safety, many embedded systems are still tested manually. To this end, we propose a process, supported by an online decision support system, for ordering and selection of test cases based on the test result of previously executed test cases. To analyze the economic efficiency of such a system, a customized return on investment (ROI) metric tailored for system integration testing is introduced. Using data collected from the development process of a large-scale safety-critical embedded system, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the expected ROI of three variants of the proposed new process.

Regression testing is the process of re-testing a software system after changes have been made to ensure that the new version of the system has retained the capabilities of the old version and that no new defects have been introduced. Regression testing is an essential activity, but it is also time-consuming and costly. Thus, regression testing should concentrate on those parts of the system that have been modified or which are affected by changes. Regression test selection has been proposed over three decades ago and, since then, it has been frequently in the focus of empirical studies. However, regression test selection is still not widely adopted in practice. Together with the test team of an industrial software company we have developed a tool-based approach that assists software testers in selecting regression test cases based on change information and test coverage data. This paper describes the main usage scenario of the approach, illustrates the implemented solution, and reports on its evaluation in a large industry project. The evaluation showed that the tool support reduces the time required for compiling regression test suites and fosters an accurate selection of regression test cases.

Regression testing is a crucial verification process that compares any new release of a software-based component against its previous versions, by executing available test cases. However, limited testing time makes selection of test cases in regression testing challenging, and some selection criteria must be respected. Validation engineers usually address this problem, coined as test suite reduction (TSR), through manual analysis or by using approximation techniques. In this paper, we address the TSR problem with sound artificial intelligence techniques such as constraint programming (CP) and global constraints. By using distinct cost-value-aggregating criteria, we propose several constraint-optimization models to find a subset of test cases that cover all the test requirements and optimize the overall cost of selected test cases. Our contribution includes reuse of existing preprocessing rules to simplify the problem before solving it and the design of structure-aware heuristics that take into account the notion of the costs associated with test cases. The work presented in this paper has been motivated by an industrial application in the communication domain. Our overall goal is to develop a constraint-based approach of test suite reduction that can be deployed to test a complete product line of conferencing systems in continuous delivery mode. By implementing this approach in a software prototype tool and experimentally evaluating it on both randomly generated and industrial instances, we hope to foster a quick adoption of the technology.

Test suite reduction, an NP-hard problem in software engineering, aims to select a subset of test cases to reduce the time cost of test execution in satisfying test requirements. Recently, search based software engineering provides a new direction to test suite reduction by connecting software engineering problems with computational intelligence methods. In this paper, we propose a multi-level optimization algorithm to simplify the original problem instance of test suite reduction. In each level, we search for local optimal solutions with random walk in potential subsets of the test suite. The problem scale is reduced by locking the intersection of local optima and by discarding shielded test cases with no contribution to test requirements.

These issues include: varying effectiveness of algorithms for test case selection/prioritization, large amounts of shared (non-specific) coverage between different tests, high redundancy of coverage data, and randomness of test results (i.e. flaky tests), as well as of the coverage data (e.g. due to concurrency issues). We address these issues by several approaches. First, our study shows that compared to standard algorithms, so-called overlap-aware solvers can achieve up to 50% higher code coverage in a fixed time budget, significantly increasing the effectiveness of test case prioritization and selection. We also detected in our project high redundancy of line coverage data (up to 97%), providing opportunities for data size reduction. Finally, we show that removal of coverage shared by tests can significantly increase test specificity.

The Retecs method uses reinforcement learning to select and prioritize test cases according to their duration, previous last execution and failure history. In a constantly changing environment, where new test cases are created and obsolete test cases are deleted, the Retecs method learns to prioritize error-prone test cases higher under guidance of a reward function and by observing previous CI cycles.

Before a new revision may be integrated, developers practice regression testing to ensure that the latest changes do not break any previously established functionality. The cost of regression testing is high, due to an increase in the number of revisions that are introduced per day, as well as the number of tests developers write per revision.

Existing dynamic RTS techniques support only projects written in a single programming language, which is unfortunate knowing that an open-source project is on average written in several programming languages. We present the first dynamic RTS technique that does not stop at predefined language boundaries. Our technique dynamically detects, at the operating system level, all file artifacts a test depends on. Our technique is, hence, oblivious to the specific means the test uses to actually access the files: be it through spawning a new process, invoking a system call, invoking a library written in a different language, invoking a library that spawns a process which makes a system call, etc. We also provide a set of extension points which allow for a smooth integration with testing frameworks and build systems.

In the model-based testing (MBT) context, such techniques are usually based on heuristics related to structural elements of the model and derived test cases. In this sense, techniques' performance may vary due to a number of factors. While empirical studies comparing the performance of TCP techniques have already been presented in literature, there is still little knowledge, particularly in the MBT context, about which factors may influence the outcomes suggested by a TCP technique. In a previous family of empirical studies focusing on labeled transition systems, we identified that the model layout, i.e., amount of branches, joins, and loops in the model, alone may have little influence on the effectiveness of TCP techniques investigated, whereas characteristics of test cases that actually fail definitely influences this aspect. However, we considered only synthetic artifacts in the study, which reduced the ability of representing properly the reality. In this paper, we present a replication of one of these studies, now with a larger and more representative selection of techniques and considering test suites from industrial systems as experimental objects.

To cope with this challenge, researchers have proposed various regression test-selection techniques. Objective: This paper was motivated by a real industrial need to improve regression-testing practices in the context of a safety-critical industrial software in the defence domain in Turkey. To address our objective, we set up and conducted an “action-research” collaborative project between industry and academia. Method: After a careful literature review, we selected a conceptual multi-objective regression-test selection framework (called MORTO) and adopted it to our industrial context by developing a custom-built genetic algorithm (GA) based on that conceptual framework. GA is able to provide full coverage of the affected (changed) requirements while considering multiple cost and benefit factors of regression testing. e.g., minimizing the number of test cases, and maximizing cumulative number of detected faults by each test suite. Results: The empirical results of applying the approach on the Software Under Test (SUT) demonstrate that this approach yields a more efficient test suite (in terms of costs and benefits) compared to the old (manual) test-selection approach, used in the company, and another applicable approach chosen from the literature. With this new approach, regression selection process in the project under study is not ad-hoc anymore. Furthermore, we have been able to eliminate the subjectivity of regression testing and its dependency on expert opinions. Conclusion: Since the proposed approach has been beneficial in saving the costs of regression testing, it is currently in active use in the company. We believe that other practitioners can apply our approach in their regression-testing contexts too, when applicable. Furthermore, this paper contributes to the body of evidence in regression testing by offering a success story of successful implementation and application of multi-objective regression testing in practice. © 2018",Information and Software Technology,Elsevier,Query,10.1016/j.infsof.2018.06.007,2018-06-30,,Orchestration technique,,X,,,Defense software,,TRUE,TRUE,"Defense software system (up to 3588 TCs)

To decide whether to use TSR or not, a developer needs some way to predict how well the reduced test suite will detect real faults in the future compared to the original test suite. Prior research evaluated the cost of TSR using only program versions with seeded faults, but such evaluations do not explicitly predict the effectiveness of the reduced test suite in future builds.

We perform the first extensive study of TSR using real test failures in (failed) builds that occurred for real code changes. We analyze 1478 failed builds from 32 GitHub projects that run their tests on Travis. Each failed build can have multiple faults, so we propose a family of mappings from test failures to faults. We use these mappings to compute Failed-Build Detection Loss (FBDL), the percentage of failed builds where the reduced test suite misses to detect all the faults detected by the original test suite. We find that FBDL can be up to 52.2%, which is higher than suggested by traditional TSR metrics.

To achieve this, we investigated six open-source projects, each of which included several builds over a large time period. Findings indicate that previous failure knowledge seems to have strong predictive power in CI environments and can be used to effectively prioritize tests. HBTP does not necessarily need to have large data, and its effectiveness improves to a certain degree with larger history interval. DBTP can be used effectively during the early stages, when no historical data is available, and also combined with HBTP to improve its effectiveness.

2018,"Zhang, Lingming",Hybrid regression test selection,zhang_hybrid_2018,"Regression testing is crucial but can be extremely costly. Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS.

We introduce the FAST family of test case prioritization techniques that radically changes this landscape by borrowing algorithms commonly exploited in the big data domain to find similar items. FAST techniques provide scalable similarity-based test case prioritization in both white-box and black-box fashion. The results from experimentation on real world C and Java subjects show that the fastest members of the family outperform other black-box approaches in e ciency with no significant impact on e ectiveness, and also outperform white-box approaches, including greedy ones, if preparation time is not counted.

However, test prioritization effectiveness is usually measured in terms of the average percentage of faults detected concerned with the number of test executions, rather than the actual regression testing time, making it unclear which technique is optimal in actual regression testing time. To answer this question, this paper first conducts an empirical study to investigate the actual regression testing time of various prioritization techniques. The results reveal a number of practical guidelines. In particular, no prioritization technique can always perform optimal in practice. To achieve the optimal prioritization effectiveness for any given project in practice, based on the findings of this study, we design learning-based Predictive Test Prioritization (PTP). PTP predicts the optimal prioritization technique for a given project based on the test distribution analysis (i.e., the distribution of test coverage, testing time, and coverage per unit time). The results show that PTP correctly predicts the optimal prioritization technique for 46 out of 50 open-source projects from GitHub, outperforming stateof- the-art techniques significantly in regression testing time, e.g., 43.16% to 94.92% improvement in detecting the first regression fault.

We present Selfection, an RTS tool for projects written in C; we discuss the key challenges to develop Selfection and our design decisions. Selfection uses the objdump and readelf tools to statically build a dependency graph of functions from binaries and detect modified code elements. We integrated Selfection in TizenRT and evaluated its benefits if tests are run in an emulator and on a supported hardware platform (ARTIK 053). We used the latest 150 revisions of TizenRT available on GitHub. We measured the benefits of Selfection as the reduction in the number of tests and reduction in test execution time over running all tests at each revision (i.e., RetestAll). Our results show that Selfection can reduce, on average, the number of tests to 4.95% and end-to-end execution time to 7.04% when tests are executed in the emulator, and to 5.74% and 26.82% when tests are executed on the actual hardware.

In modern continuous integration and deployment environments, each change requires a set of tests to be run. This volume of tests leads to multiple test requests being made simultaneously, which warrant prioritization of such requests. Previous work on test prioritization schedules queued tests at set time intervals. However, after a test has been scheduled it will never be reprioritized even if new higher risk tests arrive. Furthermore, as each test finishes, new information is available which could be used to reprioritize tests. In this work, we use the conditional failure probability among tests to reprioritize tests after each test run. This means that tests can be reprioritized hundreds of times as they wait to be run. Our approach is scalable because we do not depend on static analysis or coverage measures and simply prioritize tests based on their co-failure probability distributions. We named this approach CODYNAQ and in particular, we propose three prioritization variants called CODYNAQSINGLE, CODYNAQDOUBLE and CODYNAQFLEXI. We evaluate our approach on two data sets, CHROME and Google testing data. We find that our co-failure dynamic re-prioritization approach, CODYNAQ, outperforms the default order, FIFOBASELINE, finding the first failure and all failures for a change request by 31% and 62% faster, respectively.

2019,"Guo, Bo; Kwon, Young-Woo; Song, Myoungkyu",Decomposing Composite Changes for Code Review and Regression Test Selection in Evolving Software,guo_decomposing_2019,"Inspecting and testing code changes typically require a significant amount of developer effort. As a system evolves, developers often create composite changes by mixing multiple development issues, as opposed to addressing one independent issue — an atomic change. Inspecting composite changes often becomes time-consuming and error-prone. To test unrelated edits on composite changes, rerunning all regression tests may require excessive time. To address the problem, we present an interactive technique for change decomposition to support code reviews and regression test selection, called ChgCutter. When a developer specifies code change within a diff patch, ChgCutter partitions composite changes into a set of related atomic changes, which is more cohesive and self-contained regarding the issue being addressed. For composite change inspection, it generates an intermediate program version that only includes a related change subset using program dependence relationships. For cost reduction during regression testing, it safely selects only affected tests responsible for changes to an intermediate version. In the evaluation, we apply ChgCutter to 28 composite changes in four open source projects. ChgCutter partitions these changes with 95.7% accuracy, while selecting affected tests with 89.0% accuracy. We conduct a user study with professional software engineers at PayPal and find that ChgCutter is helpful in understanding and validating composite changes, scaling to industry projects. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.",Journal of Computer Science and Technology ,Springer,Query,10.1007/s11390-019-1917-9,2019-03-22,,Orchestration technique,,X,,,General (Java),,TRUE,FALSE,"Generated test suite based on four open-source Java projects (totaling 3456 TCs)

Among various types of tests, web service tests are usually one of the most expensive (due to network communications) but widely adopted types of tests in commercial software development. Regression test selection (RTS) aims to reduce the number of tests which need to be retested by only running tests that are affected by code changes. Although a large number of RTS techniques have been proposed in the past few decades, these techniques have not been adopted on large-scale web service testing. This is because most existing RTS techniques either require direct code dependency between tests and code under test or cannot be applied on large scale systems with enough efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel RTS technique, TestSage, that performs RTS for web service tests on large scale commercial software. With a small overhead, TestSage is able to collect fine grained (function level) dependency between test and service under test that do not directly depend on each other. TestSage has also been successfully applied to large complex systems with over a million functions. We conducted experiments of TestSage on a large scale backend service at Google. Experimental results show that TestSage reduces 34% of testing time when running all AEC (Analysis, Execution and Collection) phases, 50% of testing time while running without collection phase.

These changes can be due to the addition of new features or the modification of existing features to support customer requests or to patch faults in the system. Given that Web applications have a large surface area subject to attack, changes often include security fixes either in response to malicious attacks or to forestall such attacks. Effective regression testing should ensure that any change does not disable existing features or compromise security. Executing the entire regression test suite takes time and consumes many resources. One approach is to focus regression test efforts only on code paths that were modified in the new version. Such code paths can be identified using tools such as PHP Analysis and Regression Testing Engine (PARTE). In this paper, we extend this approach to test selection where a subset of existing tests that cover the modified code paths can be detected. To further reduce the amount of regression testing needed, we used PARTE’s reusable constraint value information to identify tests that can be reused against the new version without having to modify the input test values.

A modern web-based UI is an amalgam of reports from dozens of microservices written by multiple teams. Queries on a page that opens up another will fail if any of that page's microservices fails. As a result, the overall cost for automated UI testing is high since the UI elements cannot be tested in isolation. For example, the entire automated UI testing suite at LexisNexis takes around 30 hours (3-5 hours on the cloud) to execute, which slows down the continuous integration process.
To mitigate this problem and give developers faster feedback on their code, test case prioritization techniques are used to reorder the automated UI test cases so that more failures can be detected earlier. Given that much of the automated UI testing is ""black box"" in nature, very little information (only the test case descriptions and testing results) can be utilized to prioritize these automated UI test cases. Hence, this paper evaluates 17 ""black box"" test case prioritization approaches that do not rely on source code information. Among these, we propose a novel TCP approach, that dynamically re-prioritizes the test cases when new failures are detected, by applying and adapting a state of the art framework from the total recall problem.

The approaches are very general since they only use as input the test cases themselves (test source code or command line input).We evaluate four approaches in a version that selects a fixed budget B of test cases, and also in an adequate version that does the reduction guaranteeing some fixed coverage. The results show that the approaches yield a fault detection loss comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, while providing huge gains in terms of efficiency. When applied to a suite of more than 500K real world test cases, the most efficient of the four approaches could select B test cases (for varying B values) in less than 10 seconds.",2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),IEEE,Query,10.1109/ICSE.2019.00055,2019-08-26,,Orchestration technique,,,X,,General (Java),,TRUE,FALSE,"SIR and Defects4J

2019,"Shi, August; Zhao, Peiyuan; Marinov, Darko",Understanding and improving regression test selection in continuous integration,shi_understanding_2019,"Developers rely on regression testing in their continuous integration (CI) environment to find changes that introduce regression faults. While regression testing is widely practiced, it can be costly. Regression test selection (RTS) reduces the cost of regression testing by not running the tests that are unaffected by the changes. Industry has adopted module-level RTS for their CI environment, while researchers have proposed class-level RTS. In this paper, we compare module-and class-level RTS techniques in a cloud-based CI environment, Travis. We also develop and evaluate a hybrid RTS technique that combines aspects of the module-and class-level RTS techniques. We evaluate all the techniques on real Travis builds. We find that the RTS techniques do save testing time compared to running all tests (RetestAll), but the percentage of time for a full build using RTS (76.0%) is not as low as found in previous work, due to the extra overhead in a cloud-based CI environment. Moreover, we inspect test failures from RetestAll builds, and although we find that RTS techniques can miss to select failed tests, these test failures are almost all flaky test failures. As such, RTS techniques provide additional value in helping developers avoid wasting time debugging failures not related to the recent code changes. Overall, our results show that RTS can be beneficial for the developers in the CI environment, and RTS not only saves time but also avoids misleading developers by flaky test failures.",2019 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),IEEE,forward,10.1109/ISSRE.2019.00031,2020-02-10,,,,X,,,Cloud-based continuous integration,,TRUE,FALSE,"Open-source Java projects (up to 335 TCs)

In such environments, Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques play an important role to reduce regression testing costs, establishing a test case execution order that usually maximizes early fault detection. Existing works on TCP in CI environments (TCPCI) present some limitations. Few pieces of work consider CI particularities, such as the test case volatility, that is, they do not consider the dynamic environment of the software life-cycle in which new test cases can be added or removed (discontinued), characteristic related to the Exploration versus Exploitation (EvE) dilemma. To solve such a dilemma an approach needs to balance: i) the diversity of test suite; and ii) the quantity of new test cases and test cases that are error-prone or that comprise high fault-detection capabilities. To deal with this, most approaches use, besides the failure-history, other measures that rely on code instrumentation or require additional information, such as testing coverage. However, to maintain the information updated can be difficult and time-consuming, not scalable due to the test budget of CI environments. In this context, and to properly deal with the TCPCI problem, this work presents an approach based on Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) called COLEMAN (Combinatorial VOlatiLE Multi-Armed BANdit). The TCPCI problem falls into the category of volatile and combinatorial MAB, because multiple arms (test cases) need to be selected, and they are added or removed over the cycles. We conducted an evaluation considering three time budgets and eleven systems. The results show the applicability of our approach and that COLEMAN outperforms the most similar approach from literature in terms of early fault detection and performance.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,IEEE,query refresh 2,10.1109/TSE.2020.2992428,2020-05-04,,Orchestration technique,X,,,,Continuous integration,,TRUE,TRUE,"Industrial open-source, medium to large scale

While TCP has been studied for over 20 years, it was almost always evaluated using seeded faults/mutants as opposed to using real test failures. In this work, we study the recent change-aware information retrieval (IR) technique for TCP. Prior work has shown it performing better than traditional coverage-based TCP techniques, but it was only evaluated on a small-scale dataset with a cost-unaware metric based on seeded faults/mutants. We extend the prior work by conducting a much larger and more realistic evaluation as well as proposing enhancements that substantially improve the performance. In particular, we evaluate the original technique on a large-scale, real-world software-evolution dataset with real failures using both cost-aware and cost-unaware metrics under various configurations. Also, we design and evaluate hybrid techniques combining the IR features, historical test execution time, and test failure frequencies. Our results show that the change-aware IR technique outperforms stateof-the-art coverage-based techniques in this real-world setting, and our hybrid techniques improve even further upon the original IR technique. Moreover, we show that flaky tests have a substantial impact on evaluating the change-aware TCP techniques based on real test failures.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in various challenging scenarios that require continuous adaptation, such as game playing, real-time ads bidding, and recommender systems. Inspired by this line of work and building on initial efforts in supporting test case prioritization with RL techniques, we perform here a comprehensive investigation of RL-based test case prioritization in a CI context. To this end, taking test case prioritization as a ranking problem, we model the sequential interactions between the CI environment and a test case prioritization agent as an RL problem, using three alternative ranking models. We then rely on carefully selected and tailored state-of-the-art RL techniques to automatically and continuously learn a test case prioritization strategy, whose objective is to be as close as possible to the optimal one.

Using various information sources, including test traces, build dependencies, version control data, and test histories, they have been shown to be effective. However, not all of these sources are guaranteed to be available and accessible for arbitrary continuous integration (CI) environments. In contrast, metadata from version control systems (VCSs) and CI systems are readily available and inexpensive. Yet, corresponding RTP and RTS techniques are scattered across research and often only evaluated on synthetic faults or in a specific industrial context. It is cumbersome for practitioners to identify insights that apply to their context, let alone to calibrate associated parameters for maximum cost-effectiveness. This paper consolidates existing work on RTP and unsafe RTS into an actionable methodology to build and evaluate such approaches that exclusively rely on CI and VCS metadata. To investigate how these approaches from prior research compare in heterogeneous settings, we apply the methodology in a large-scale empirical study on a set of 23 projects covering 37,000 CI logs and 76,000 VCS commits. We find that these approaches significantly outperform established RTP baselines and, while still triggering 90% of the failures, we show that practitioners can expect to save on average 84% of test execution time for unsafe RTS. We also find that it can be beneficial to limit training data, features from test history work better than change-based features, and, somewhat surprisingly, simple and well-known heuristics often outperform complex machine-learned models.

Unlike existing techniques, the proposed model does not require complex feature extraction techniques. Consequently, it scales to hundreds of repositories of varying characteristics while capturing more than 99% of buggy pull requests. Additionally, to better evaluate test selection models, we propose application-specific metrics that capture both a reduction in resource cost and a reduction in pull-request turn-around time.

A regression test selection (RTS) technique chooses a subset of existing test cases to ensure that the system will not be adversely affected by the latest modifications. With the rise of DevOps, behavior-driven development (BDD) is growing in popularity as it is in close alignment with agile practices, for example, continuous integration. Hence, it is necessary to propose a novel and effective RTS technique for BDD specifically to accelerate the development process while ensuring software quality. Since most existing techniques for RTS are code-based and thus subject to some limitations, we present a requirement-based technique which uses the requirements in BDD to select test cases in both high-level (acceptance testing) and low-level (unit testing). Our technique firstly illustrates the new requirement with a scenario, and subsequently computes the semantic similarity of the new scenario and all existing scenarios with the vector space model. According to the results, the modification-traversing regression test cases can be selected in a semi-automated way.

To address this problem, existing researchers made dedicated efforts on test prioritization, which optimizes the execution order of tests to detect faults earlier; while practitioners in industry leveraged more computing resources to save the time cost of regression testing. By combining these two orthogonal solutions, in this article, we define the problem of parallel test prioritization, which is to conduct test prioritization in the scenario of parallel test execution to reduce the cost of regression testing.Different from traditional sequential test prioritization, parallel test prioritization aims at generating a set of test sequences, each of which is allocated in an individual computing resource and executed in parallel. In particular, we propose eight parallel test prioritization techniques by adapting the existing four sequential test prioritization techniques, by including and excluding testing time in prioritization.To investigate the performance of the eight parallel test prioritization techniques, we conducted an extensive study on 54 open-source projects and a case study on 16 commercial projects from Baidu, a famous search service provider with 600M monthly active users. According to the two studies, parallel test prioritization does improve the efficiency of regression testing, and cost-aware additional parallel test prioritization technique significantly outperforms the other techniques, indicating that this technique is a good choice for practical parallel testing. Besides, we also investigated the influence of two external factors, the number of computing resources and time allowed for parallel testing, and find that more computing resources indeed improve the performance of parallel test prioritization. In addition, we investigated the influence of two more factors, test granularity and coverage criterion, and find that parallel test prioritization can still accelerate regression testing in parallel scenario. Moreover, we investigated the benefit of parallel test prioritization on the regression testing process of continuous integration, considering both the cumulative acceleration performance and the overhead of prioritization techniques, and the results demonstrate the superiority of parallel test prioritization.",ACM Trans.

Test prioritization is a method that can improve the efficiency of continuous integration testing by selecting test cases that can detect faults in the early stage of each cycle. As continuous integration testing produces voluminous test execution data, test history is a commonly used artifact in test prioritization. However, existing test prioritization techniques for continuous integration either cannot handle large test history or are optimized for using a limited number of historical test cycles. We show that such a limitation can decrease fault detection effectiveness of prioritized test suites. This work introduces DeepOrder, a deep learning-based model that works on the basis of regression machine learning. DeepOrder ranks test cases based on the historical record of test executions from any number of previous test cycles. DeepOrder learns failed test cases based on multiple factors including the duration and execution status of test cases. We experimentally show that deep neural networks, as a simple regression model, can be efficiently used for test case prioritization in continuous integration testing.

However, little work has taken the efficiency problem of these techniques into account. In this paper, we target the Greedy Additional (GA) algorithm, which has been widely recognized to be effective but less efficient, and try to improve its efficiency while preserving effectiveness. In our Accelerated GA (AGA) algorithm, we use some extra data structures to reduce redundant data accesses in the GA algorithm and thus the time complexity is reduced from O(m2n) to O(kmn) when n > m, where m is the number of test cases, n is the number of program elements, and k is the iteration number. Moreover, we observe the impact of iteration numbers on prioritization efficiency on our dataset and propose to use a specific iteration number in the AGA algorithm to further improve the efficiency. We conducted experiments on 55 open-source subjects. In particular, we implemented each TCP algorithm with two kinds of widely-used input formats, adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Since a TCP algorithm with adjacency matrix is less efficient than the algorithm with adjacency list, the result analysis is mainly conducted based on TCP algorithms with adjacency list. The results show that AGA achieves 5.95X speedup ratio over GA on average, while it achieves the same average effectiveness as GA in terms of Average Percentage of Fault Detected (APFD). Moreover, we conducted an industrial case study on 22 subjects, collected from Baidu, and find that the average speedup ratio of AGA over GA is 44.27X, which indicates the practical usage of AGA in real-world scenarios.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,IEEE,forward,10.1109/TSE.2021.3137929,2021-12-23,,Proposed Algorithm/Case study,X,,,,Accelerated Greedy Additional for TCP,,TRUE,"TRUE

These changes can adversely introduce regression faults, causing previously working functions to fail. Regression testing is essential for maintaining the quality of evolving complex software, but it can be overly time-consuming when the size of the test suite is large, or the execution of the test cases takes a long time. There are extensive research studies on selective regression testing aiming at minimizing the size of the regression test suite while maximizing the detection of the regression faults. However, most of the existing techniques focus on the regression faults caused by the code changes, the impact of the context changes on the non-modified software has barely been explored. This paper presents a context-aware regression test selection (CARTS) approach that not only accounts for the modification of code but also changes in the execution context, including libraries, external APIs, and databases. After a change, CARTS uses the program invariants denoted in the pre- and postconditions of a function to determine if the function is affected by the change and selects all the test cases that executed the modified code as well as the non-modified functions whose preconditions are affected by the change. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted empirical studies on multi-release open-source software and case studies on real-world systems that have ongoing changes in code as well as in the execution context. The results of our controlled experiments show that with an average of 32.5% of the regression test cases, CARTS selected all the fault-revealing test cases. In the case studies, all the fault-revealing test cases were selected by using an average of 25.3% of the regression test suite. These results suggest that CARTS can be effective for selecting fault-revealing test cases for both code and execution context changes.",2021 28th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC),IEEE,forward,10.1109/APSEC53868.2021.00050,2022-02-17,,Technique analysis,,X,,,,,"TRUE

Researchers showed that RTS based on program analysis can save substantial testing time for (medium-sized) open-source projects. Practitioners also showed that RTS based on machine learning (ML) works well on very large code repositories, e.g., in Facebook's monorepository. We combine analysis-based RTS and ML-based RTS by using the latter to choose a subset of tests selected by the former.

We present and evaluate a test case selection approach in the context of black-box regression testing of embedded systems. In this context, it is challenging to relate test cases with a set of distinct source code elements to be able to select those test cases associated with the modified parts of the source code. We analyze previously fixed defects for this purpose. We relate test cases that detect these defects with the source files that are previously modified for fixing them. Then, we select test cases related with source code files that are modified in the subsequent revision. The strength of this relation is determined as the number of changes associated with fixed defects previously detected by the same test cases.

However, most of them use a limited number of features for training ML models and evaluate the models on subjects for which the application of TCP makes little practical sense, due to their small regression testing time and low number of failed builds.

Second, based on this data model, we define a comprehensive set of features that covers all features previously used by related studies. Third, we develop methods and tools to collect the defined features for 25 open-source software systems with enough failed builds and whose regression testing takes at least five minutes.
